        "A Wisconsin jury acquitted Kyle Rittenhouse for shooting three people, two fatally, during a racial justice protest in Kenosha, based on self-defense.",
        "Rittenhouse drove from Illinois to Kenosha, where he obtained an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle amid violent protests.",
        "The prosecution argued Rittenhouse provoked the encounter and could not claim self-defense, a point the jury ultimately rejected.",
        "Rittenhouse's acquittal might influence the outcome of another high-profile self-defense case in Georgia involving Ahmaud Arbery.",
        "The law of self-defense is based on five elements: proportionality of force, limitation to imminent harm, reasonability of the fear of harm, no benefit for the first aggressor, and the duty to retreat if safely possible.",
        "States vary in their self-defense laws, with some adopting 'stand your ground' laws that remove the duty to retreat outside the home.",
        "The 'castle doctrine' allows for lethal force in self-defense without a duty to retreat when in one's home.",
        "The Zimmerman trial, involving the shooting of Trayvon Martin, brought 'stand your ground' laws under national scrutiny.",
        "Prosecutor Thomas Binger argued that Rittenhouse lost the right to self-defense when he provoked the incident.",
        "The jury found that Rittenhouse was reasonably in fear for his safety, a high bar for the prosecution to contest."
