        "Citigroup, acting for Revlon, mistakenly sent $893 million instead of $7.8 million to Revlon's lenders due to a UI error.",
        "The error happened during an attempt to make an interest payment; Citigroup accidentally paid the entire loan balance.",
        "The loan was not due until 2023, and Citigroup attempted to reclaim the funds, but lost roughly $500 million.",
        "U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman ruled against Citigroup in a trial regarding the mishap.",
        "The payment error was attributed to poorly designed UI of the financial software called Flexcube.",
        "Flexcube required entering the transaction as if paying off the entire loan, but directing the principal to a 'wash account'.",
        "The mistake occurred when a subcontractor failed to correctly set multiple fields to redirect the principal to the wash account.",
        "Three Citibank officials signed off on the transaction, believing the principal would stay within Citibank.",
        "The UI design was criticized for not having safeguards or warning features to prevent such errors.",
        "The incident highlights a potential market demand for better-designed financial software."
