        "Citibank mistakenly transferred approximately $900 million to Revlon's lenders instead of $7.8 million in interest due to an error in executing a transaction.",
        "The funds were intended for an internal \"wash account\" but ended up being sent directly to the creditors due to unmarked checkboxes in Citibank's software system.",
        "Some lenders refused to return the mistakenly transferred funds, citing New York's \"discharge-for-value\" exception.",
        "Citibank's lawsuit to recover the unreturned funds focused on whether the lenders knew the payments were a mistake at the time they were made.",

        "The case emphasizes the importance of complete metadata in interpreting communication accurately.",
        "Critique on poorly designed software and user interfaces suggests that clearer instructions and user-friendly terminology could have prevented the mistake.",
