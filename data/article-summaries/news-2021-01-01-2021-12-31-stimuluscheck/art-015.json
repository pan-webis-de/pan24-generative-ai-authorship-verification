        "President-elect Joe Biden introduces a new $1.9 trillion 'rescue plan' which includes an additional $1,400 in direct payment to Americans.",
        "Biden aims to provide a total of $2,000 in cash relief combined with the previously distributed $600.",
        "$465 billion of Biden's plan is designated for direct payments to Americans.",
        "The additional $1,400 payment also applies to all dependents, expanding eligibility beyond those under 17 to include college students and disabled adults.",
        "Income eligibility for the new $1,400 payment would likely follow the same criteria as the current $600 stimulus payments.",
        "Payments would gradually reduce for individuals with an AGI over $75,000 and married couples with an AGI over $150,000, adjusting with the number of dependents.",
        "Eligibility for the payment would be determined based on the most recent tax return and adjusted gross income.",
        "The IRS used 2019 tax returns to determine eligibility for the second round of checks.",
        "America's poorest families would see a significant increase in income, with the lowest 20% of households experiencing a 29% income increase with the $2,000 checks.",
        "For comparison, the current $600 payment raises income for the same group by 8%, and the $1,200 CARES Act payments increased it by 11%."
