        "Derek Chauvin and three other former officers, J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane, and Tou Thao, were federally indicted for violating George Floyd\u2019s civil rights.",
        "The federal charges concern the deprivation of Floyd's rights under the color of law, including the use of unreasonable force and deliberate indifference to his medical needs.",
        "Chauvin additionally faces charges related to a separate 2017 incident involving excessive force against a 14-year-old.",
        "Federal civil rights charges against law enforcement officers are relatively rare, with an average of 41 cases brought annually between 1990 and 2019.",
        "To convict the officers, prosecutors must prove the actions were willful violations of rights under the color of law.",
        "The federal charges are distinct and in addition to state criminal cases, with Chauvin already convicted on state charges.",
        "Federal convictions could result in severe penalties, potentially carrying sentences of 20 years to life in prison.",
        "Plea negotiations could potentially affect the charges or sentencing.",
        "The federal court proceedings' dates have not been set, and they are unlikely to be broadcast, unlike the state trials.",
        "Experts and legal professionals provide insights into the federal charges and potential outcomes for the officers."
