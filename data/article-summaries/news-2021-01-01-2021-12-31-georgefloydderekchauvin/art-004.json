        "Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer, was sentenced to 22 1/2 years in prison for the murder of George Floyd.",
        "The sentencing is one of the longest for a U.S. police officer in the killing of a Black person but fell short of the 30 years prosecutors requested.",
        "Chauvin could be released on parole after serving two-thirds of his sentence, approximately 15 years, with good behavior.",
        "Judge Peter Cahill cited \"abuse of a position of trust and authority and also the particular cruelty\" shown to Floyd as reasons for exceeding the suggested 12 1/2-year sentence.",
        "During the sentencing, Chauvin offered condolences to the Floyd family but hinted at future developments that could bring them peace of mind.",
        "Floyd family attorney Ben Crump and other members expressed mixed feelings about the sentence, calling for real justice to involve no fear of police killings due to skin color.",
        "Chauvin's mother pleaded for mercy, describing her son as a good man unfairly portrayed.",
        "Prosecutor Matthew Frank described Chauvin’s act as \"9 1/2 minutes of cruelty\" and stressed the significance of exceeding the sentencing guidelines.",
        "Before sentencing, the judge denied Chauvin's request for a new trial and a hearing into possible juror misconduct.",
        "The three other officers involved in Floyd’s arrest face state and federal charges, with trials pending."
