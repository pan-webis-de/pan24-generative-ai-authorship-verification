        "A Minnesota judge ruled that there were aggravating factors in George Floyd's death, allowing for a possible longer sentence for Derek Chauvin.",
        "Judge Peter Cahill found Chauvin abused his position as a police officer and treated Floyd with particular cruelty.",
        "The judge also noted the presence of children during the crime and Chauvin's role in a group during the offense.",
        "Chauvin, convicted of three counts, will be sentenced on the most serious one, second-degree unintentional murder.",
        "Legal experts speculate Chauvin is unlikely to receive more than 30 years when sentenced on June 25.",
        "Prosecutors asked for an upward departure in sentencing, citing Floyd's vulnerability and Chauin's refusal to stop even after Floyd became unresponsive.",
        "The ruling gives Judge Cahill the option to sentence Chauvin above the guideline range.",
        "Cahill agreed with prosecutors on most points but did not find Floyd was particularly vulnerable due to his ability to struggle.",
        "Defense attorney Eric Nelson argued against the finding of aggravating factors, stating Chauvin was authorized to use reasonable force.",
        "Chauvin also faces federal charges alleging he violated Floyd's civil rights, which would run concurrently with any state sentence."
