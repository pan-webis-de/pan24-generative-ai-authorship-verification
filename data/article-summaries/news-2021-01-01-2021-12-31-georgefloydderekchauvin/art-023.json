        "Derek Chauvin was convicted of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter in George Floyd's death.",
        "Under Minnesota law, Chauvin will only be sentenced for the most serious charge, second-degree murder, which has a maximum sentence of 40 years.",
        "Experts predict Chauvin is unlikely to receive the maximum sentence; the realistic expectation is a maximum of 30 years due to sentencing guidelines.",
        "Minnesota's sentencing guidelines suggest a presumptive sentence of 12 1/2 years for someone with no criminal record, like Chauvin.",
        "Prosecutors are seeking an 'upward departure' from the guidelines citing aggravating factors such as Floyd's vulnerability and the presence of children during the crime.",
        "The expectation is based on precedent that an upward departure sentence should not exceed double the guideline range.",
        "Chauvin can expect to serve two-thirds of his sentence in prison with good behavior, the rest potentially on supervised release.",
        "Both defense and prosecution will submit briefs on aggravating factors, which will influence Judge Cahill's sentencing decision.",
        "A pre-sentence investigation report, typically including personal history and the offense's impact, will also be considered in the sentencing.",
        "It's uncertain if Chauvin will speak at his sentencing hearing, due to the potential impact on an appeal."
