        "The jury found Derek Chauvin guilty of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter in the death of George Floyd.",
        "Chauvin faces up to 40 years for second-degree murder, 25 years for third-degree murder, and 10 years for second-degree manslaughter, with likely lower sentences due to no prior convictions.",
        "The second-degree unintentional murder charge required proving Chauvin unintentionally caused Floyd's death while committing a felony.",
        "The third-degree murder charge concerned Chauvin perpetrating a dangerous act with a depraved mind disregarding human life.",
        "Second-degree manslaughter involved Chauvin's culpable negligence creating an unreasonable risk of death or great bodily harm.",
        "Prosecution focused on proving Chauvin used excessive force and that his actions substantially caused Floyd's death due to 'positional asphyxia'.",
        "Medical testimony for the prosecution claimed Floyd died from lack of oxygen, while the defense highlighted Floyd's drug use and heart issues.",
        "Police supervisors and use-of-force experts criticized Chauvin's actions as excessive and contrary to police training.",
        "The defense argued Chauvin's actions were within his training and portrayed the knee on Floyd's neck and back as a control technique.",
        "The charges against Chauvin differed in interpreting his intent, with each having its unique criteria based on his actions' nature and recklessness."
