        "Prosecutors in Derek Chauvin's trial have adjusted the duration of time Chauvin's knee was on George Floyd's neck to about nine minutes.",

        "Recent filings, citing police body-camera video, have now adjusted the duration to at least nine minutes.",

        "Three other officers are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter, scheduled for trial in August.",
        "The 8:46 timing became symbolic, prompting demonstrations and acts of remembrance lasting 8 minutes, 46 seconds.",
        "Prosecutors acknowledged a one-minute error but stated it would not affect the case.",

        "The exact duration of the restraint is anticipated to be a significant part of the trial, relating to Floyd's cause of death and Chauvin's state of mind."
