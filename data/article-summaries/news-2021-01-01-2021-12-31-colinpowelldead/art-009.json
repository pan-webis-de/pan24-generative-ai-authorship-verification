        "Gen. Colin Powell's funeral took place on Oct. 18 at Washington National Cathedral, following his death from complications of covid-19.",
        "Despite being a significant figure, Powell did not receive a state funeral, nor did his body lie in state at the U.S. Capitol, as per his or his family's wishes.",
        "The funeral's private nature limited public involvement and reflection on Powell's legacy, especially concerning the Iraq War and current national divides.",
        "Powell's achievements, including being the first Black Secretary of State, symbolize the kind of figure traditionally honored with a public mourning ritual in the U.S.",
        "Public funerals in the U.S. have historically allowed Americans to express collective mourning and reflect on national unity, despite political divisions.",
        "Changes in recent decades have made these rituals more inclusive, honoring Black Americans and women in addition to white male politicians and leaders.",
        "Colin Powell's career and bipartisan respect made him a deserving candidate for a full public mourning ritual.",
        "Powell's funeral did not become a public event, possibly due to his humility, his family's wishes, or concerns over it becoming a political or health risk.",
        "The absence of public mourning rituals for Powell lost an opportunity to honor his contributions and to reflect collectively on the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "Powell's death and its commemoration underscore challenges in achieving unity and bipartisanship in the current political climate."
