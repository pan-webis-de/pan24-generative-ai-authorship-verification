        "In 1973, Rennie Davis, a prominent antiwar activist, shifted from political activism to spiritual enlightenment, advocating for the teachings of Guru Maharaj Ji.",
        "Davis was once a key figure in the anti-Vietnam War movement, participating in the May Day protests and being one of the Chicago Seven.",

        "His transition to spiritual advocacy led to mixed reactions, with some activists feeling betrayed and others intrigued by the new direction.",
        "Davis's involvement with Guru Maharaj Ji's Divine Light Mission marked a significant shift from his previous political work to a focus on personal and global transformation through spirituality.",
        "After distancing from political activism, Davis explored various spiritual and New Age practices, eventually devoting himself to teaching meditation and building a 'new humanity' movement with his third wife.",
        "Throughout the 1970s, many former activists turned to mystical religions and inner change as a means to effect social change.",
