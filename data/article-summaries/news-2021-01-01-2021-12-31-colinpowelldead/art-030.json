        "Colin L. Powell, the first Black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, announced he was a Republican in November 1995 but never sought the presidency.",
        "Powell aimed to move the Republican Party closer to the spirit of Lincoln, promoting racial diversity and welcoming immigrants.",
        "His vision contrasted sharply with the direction the GOP took under Donald Trump, emphasizing anti-immigrant rhetoric and populism.",
        "Powell endorsed Barack Obama in 2008 and later Democratic candidates, distancing himself from the GOP, especially after the January 6 insurrection.",
        "Powell was criticized by some in the GOP as a 'RINO' (Republican in Name Only) and diverged from the party due to its shift towards Trump's ideology.",
        "He died at 84 from covid-19 complications, leaving behind a complex political legacy praised across the political spectrum.",
        "Former defense secretary Leon Panetta remembered Powell as a dedicated public servant who put country ahead of party.",
        "Post-presidency, Donald Trump criticized Powell as a 'classic RINO' and for attacking Republicans.",
        "Ari Fleischer and others believe Powell's centrist approach to politics could eventually unify the increasingly polarized U.S. political landscape.",
        "Tributes from both Republicans and Democrats highlighted Powell's service, breaking barriers as a Jamaican-American, and his moral stances."
