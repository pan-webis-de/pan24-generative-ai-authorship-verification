        "Colin Powell was a popular figure expected to bring a judicious viewpoint to the George W. Bush administration.",
        "Powell's legacy includes a tradition of pragmatic internationalism and a strategic philosophy known as the Powell Doctrine.",
        "The Powell Doctrine emphasized the cautious use of U.S. military force, including overwhelming numbers, clear exit strategies, and allied support.",
        "This doctrine contrasts sharply with the Bush administration's unilateral actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, which lacked clear objectives and exit plans.",
        "Recent U.S. military engagements and withdrawals, especially from Afghanistan, reflect a renewed interest in Powellian restraint.",
        "Critics argue that adherence to the Powell Doctrine could have prevented the costly and protracted conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
        "The Powell Doctrine was influenced by Powell's Vietnam War experience and shaped his views on military engagement.",
        "Debate over military action often split between those with Vietnam War experience, who were more cautious, and those without, who were more aggressive.",
        "The Bush administration aimed to overcome the perceived limitations and self-criticism that followed the Vietnam War.",
        "Powell's warnings and principles, particularly the 'Pottery Barn' rule, may now be gaining renewed relevance amid reflections on recent U.S. military interventions."
