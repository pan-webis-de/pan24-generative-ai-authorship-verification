        "Historical precedent exists for impeaching and trying a federal official after they have left office, as seen in the case of Senator William Blount.",
        "William Blount was a U.S. senator impeached after being expelled from the Senate, similar to discussions around Trump's impeachment trial after his presidency.",
        "Blount was initially impeached for planning an attack on Spanish territories to benefit Great Britain, marking the Senate's first impeachment case.",
        "Legal experts mention that an officeholder can be tried after leaving office, and being impeached does not signal the end of a political career.",
        "Blount's case was eventually dismissed by the Senate on jurisdictional grounds, and he did not attend his trial.",
        "Constitutional law professor Stewart Harris suggests the Senate has the flexibility to conduct an impeachment trial whenever it chooses.",
        "Trump's supporters argue that impeachment could prevent him from holding future federal office; Blount's case does not directly support this theory.",
        "Blount's political career continued in Tennessee after his impeachment, indicating impeachment may not permanently harm a political figure's career.",
        "The case of Secretary of War William Belknap, impeached after resigning for bribery, is also cited as a precedent for post-office impeachment.",
        "Historians and legal experts caution that impeachment does not necessarily terminate a politician's career, as evidenced by Blount's continued popularity and political involvement."
