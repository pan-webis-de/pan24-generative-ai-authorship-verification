        "A Facebook post claims Donald Trump would lose post-presidency benefits if impeached again, including a lifetime pension, travel allowance, Secret Service detail, and the ability to run for office.",
        "PolitiFact rates this claim as 'Mostly False'.",
        "Impeachment alone doesn't strip a former president of benefits; conviction by the Senate would be required.",
        "The Former Presidents Act of 1958 details benefits like the pension and travel allowance but requires removal from office through conviction for loss of benefits.",
        "Secret Service protection for former presidents is provided under a separate 1962 law, unaffected by impeachment outcomes.",
        "Conviction in the Senate, not just impeachment, would be necessary for Trump to potentially lose his ability to run for office again.",
        "Experts state that current laws only revoke a president's benefits if convicted while in office, which is unlikely given the timing of impeachment proceedings.",
        "Congress could potentially pass a new law to strip Trump of his post-presidency benefits without needing the same two-thirds Senate vote required for conviction.",
        "The Senate has never convicted an impeached president, and the Constitution doesn't specify the vote count needed to disqualify someone from holding public office post-conviction.",
        "Experts suggest that political appetite for pursuing impeachment or conviction may wane once a president has left office, but it is not constitutionally prohibited."
