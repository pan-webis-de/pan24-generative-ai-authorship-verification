        "Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri has faced widespread criticism since he objected to the presidential election results on January 6.",
        "This criticism includes being disowned by his former mentor and labeled with derogatory terms by a Republican colleague.",
        "Despite bipartisan efforts in the past, Democrats have stopped signing onto any of his bills post-January 6.",
        "Senator Richard Blumenthal mentioned the decision to not work with Hawley is based on principles and democracy.",
        "Hawley's actions seem to have strengthened his position within the Republican grassroots, increasing speaking requests, fundraising, and his national profile.",
        "Critics argue Hawley's actions have damaged his standing, with a drop in approval ratings and calls for his resignation in Missouri.",
        "However, some polls and Republican strategists suggest his popularity among Republicans in Missouri has increased, making him a significant figure within the GOP.",
        "Hawley has raised over $2 million since January, with contributions from new donors.",
        "He is seen as a potential 2024 presidential candidate, carrying Trump's populist message without the associated baggage.",
