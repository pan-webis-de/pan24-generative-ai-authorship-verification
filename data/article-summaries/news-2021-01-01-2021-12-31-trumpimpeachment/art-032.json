        "Pennsylvania Republicans voted to rebuke Sen. Pat Toomey but did not censure him for his vote to convict Donald Trump in the impeachment trial.",
        "The vote reflects Trump's strong influence within the party and showcases internal divisions.",
        "Some members were dissatisfied, wanting a formal censure similar to actions taken in North Carolina and Louisiana.",
        "The approved statement criticized Toomey for participating in what they called a partisan attempt at political retribution by Democrats.",
        "Instead of censuring Toomey, the party unusually censured four Pennsylvania Democrats for their handling of various matters.",
        "Democrats responded by labeling the GOP as the party of Trump and extremism, inviting those disillusioned by the GOP to join them.",
        "The vote was narrowly decided at 128-124 against censuring Toomey, with 13 abstentions.",
        "Mike McMullen, a GOP committeeman, expressed dissatisfaction with the decision and hinted at targeting those opposed to censure in future party elections.",
        "Other Republicans argued that penalizing Toomey would be divisive and counterproductive.",
        "The process to address Toomey's impeachment vote had been ongoing, culminating in an online vote after technical difficulties delayed a previous attempt."
