        "A viral tweet inaccurately claims that a second impeachment of Trump would prevent him from running in 2024 and strip him of several benefits.",
        "The tweet suggests impeachment alone would lead to losing a pension, travel allowance, secret service detail, and the ability to run in 2024, all of which are false.",
        "Impeachment without removal from office does not affect Trump's post-presidency benefits or his ability to run for office again.",
        "The Former Presidents Act only revokes a president's pension if they are impeached and then removed from office by the Senate.",
        "Presidents are not given a $1 million travel allowance; this is a misunderstanding of the benefits provided to former presidents.",
        "It is uncertain whether a president removed from office would lose lifetime Secret Service protection, as there are conflicting laws.",
        "To disqualify Trump from future office, the Senate would need to have a separate vote after a conviction, a process not bypassed by impeachment alone.",
        "Legal experts are unsure if the presidency falls under an 'Office of honor, Trust or Profit' that one can be disqualified from holding after impeachment and conviction.",
        "The travel allowance mentioned is for former presidents without lifetime Secret Service protection, which does not apply to Trump as he is entitled to it.",
        "The person who posted the tweet admitted the information might be incorrect and was surprised by the tweet's viral success."
