        "The FBI's decision to withhold Gabby Petito's death cause and body from her family is deemed 'very unusual' by Dr. Michael Baden.",

        "Baden highlighted that in modern forensic practice, important samples can be retained without keeping the whole body, making the FBI's actions unusual.",
        "Investigators released the manner of death before the cause, which is not the typical procedure, according to Baden.",
        "The FBI has not commented in response to the issue being raised.",
        "Petito's family spokesperson, Rick Stafford, did not respond to inquiries about access to Petito's remains.",
