        "The Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution (TAG-VE) convened on 26 November 2021 to assess the B.1.1.529 variant.",
        "B.1.1.529 variant was first reported by South Africa to WHO on 24 November 2021, with the first known infection from 9 November 2021.",
        "The variant has a large number of mutations and preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection.",
        "B.1.1.529 cases are increasing in almost all provinces in South Africa.",
        "Current SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostics can detect this variant; the S gene target failure in one PCR test can serve as a marker for this variant.",
        "Based on the evidence, TAG-VE advised that B.1.1.529 should be designated as a Variant of Concern (VOC), named Omicron.",
        "WHO has communicated the designation of Omicron as a VOC and will continue to update on new findings.",
        "Countries are requested to enhance surveillance, sequencing, and report cases associated with VOC infection.",
