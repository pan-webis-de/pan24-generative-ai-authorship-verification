        "Nearly 200 defendants in the Capitol riot cases blame former President Donald Trump for inciting them to violence on Jan. 6.",
        "Some of the accused expressed a cult-like loyalty to Trump, claiming they were following his directives.",
        "Legal experts believe that while Trump's influence may not exonerate the accused, it could lead to reduced sentences or plea deals.",
        "Defendants have cited Trump's rhetoric, especially his speech on Jan. 6 urging supporters to \"fight like hell,\" as a call to action.",
        "Trump's defense attorneys deny he incited the riot, placing the blame on the rioters themselves.",
        "Statements by the accused that they were acting on Trump's instructions may be used in the impeachment trial against him.",
        "The concept of \"public authority defense\" might be argued, suggesting rioters believed they were acting on government orders.",
        "Experts are skeptical that shifting blame to Trump will significantly impact the legal outcomes for the accused individuals.",
        "Some rioters explicitly stated that their actions were in response to Trump's call, including storming the Capitol if he requested.",
        "The influence of Trump and other officials may be considered as a mitigating factor, though unlikely to completely absolve defendants."
