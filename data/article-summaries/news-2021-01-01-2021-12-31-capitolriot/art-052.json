        "The U.S. Justice Department refused to defend Rep. Morris \"Mo\" Brooks in a lawsuit accusing him of inciting the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, impacting former President Donald Trump's defense.",
        "The department's decision implies that inciting an attack on Congress is beyond the scope of employment for federal employees, including Representatives.",
        "Experts view this decision as a message to Trump, suggesting he won't get immunity under the Westfall Act for actions related to the Capitol riot.",
        "Trump and Brooks are co-defendants in a lawsuit by Rep. Eric Swalwell for allegedly inciting the Capitol attack to prevent Joe Biden's election certification.",
        "Trump is also facing two other lawsuits related to his actions on and before Jan. 6.",
        "Trump has not yet sought Justice Department protection, and his primary defense does not rely on the Westfall Act but on presidential immunity.",
        "The Justice Department's recent actions have caused concern among some Democrats but are seen as protecting the office of the presidency, not Trump personally.",
        "The refusal to defend Brooks may indicate a tougher stance against Trump, with legal experts suggesting it's bad news for him.",
        "Brooks' attempt to use the Westfall Act for immunity was rejected, indicating Trump might face similar challenges.",
        "Legal experts believe Trump's case is weaker than Brooks', as Trump had no official role in the election certification process."
