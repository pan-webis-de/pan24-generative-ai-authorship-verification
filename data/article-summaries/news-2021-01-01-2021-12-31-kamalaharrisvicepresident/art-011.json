        "Kamala Harris and her husband, Douglas Emhoff, are still living out of suitcases at Blair House due to ongoing renovations at the vice presidential residence more than two months after her inauguration.",
        "Harris is the first woman and the first woman of color to hold the office of vice president in the United States.",
        "The reason behind the prolonged renovation period at the vice president's official residence is unclear, leading to frustration for Harris.",
        "Renovations and upkeep of the vice president's residence, a 9,000-plus square feet mansion built in 1893, include substantial government contracts for various works.",
        "Harris reportedly requested work on the kitchen, although her deputy press secretary later stated no such work is being conducted.",
        "Historically, new vice presidents may delay moving into the official residence to allow for maintenance and upgrades.",
        "Temporary accommodations at Blair House offer luxury but do not provide the casual, informal atmosphere Harris and Emhoff prefer.",
        "The vice president's residence offers more privacy, fewer staff, and less formality compared to the White House.",
        "Previous vice presidents have personalized the residence with unique features such as a heated pool and a horseshoe pit.",
        "Harris, who values fitness and cooking, looks forward to utilizing the residence's outdoor space and potentially personalizing it."
