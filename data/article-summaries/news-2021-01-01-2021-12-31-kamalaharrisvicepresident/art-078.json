        "Ashli Babbitt was a 35-year-old Air Force veteran from Southern California who supported Donald Trump and participated in the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021.",
        "Before her involvement in the riot, Babbitt struggled with personal and financial troubles, including a crippling amount of debt.",
        "On the day of the riot, Babbitt was shot by police while attempting to leap through the broken window of a door inside the Capitol, becoming the first fatality of the event.",
        "Babbitt had a long military career but faced challenges due to discipline issues and insubordination, leading to her discharge as a senior airman.",
        "Her belief in conspiracy theories, particularly QAnon, intensified as Trump's presidency neared its end.",
        "Babbitt believed in the QAnon myth that January 6 would be 'the storm' when Trump would capture and execute his opponents.",
        "She had a history of confrontational behavior, including an incident where she was involved in a car chase and collision with her husband's ex, leading to protective orders against her.",
        "Her involvement in the Capitol riot and subsequent death turned her into a martyr figure for some within the movement she supported.",
        "Babbitt's transformation from a military service member to a participant in one of democracy's most grievous attacks reflected a journey fueled by paranoia and conspiratorial beliefs.",
        "Her social media activity, military and court records, and interviews with acquaintances reveal a complex portrait of devotion, struggle, and radicalization."
