        "A 224,000-ton container ship, Ever Given, has blocked the Suez Canal, causing potential major trade disruptions.",
        "Shipping experts stress that even slight delays can lead to significant congestion and disturb the delivery of goods.",
        "The severity of the disruption depends on how quickly the Ever Given can be removed; it has been partially re-floated.",
        "The Suez Canal is a crucial trade route between Asia and Europe, handling roughly one eighth of all sea-transported goods in 2019.",
        "The blockage happens at a time when trade is increasing post-Chinese New Year and businesses are restocking for post-pandemic expectations.",
        "Global shortage of shipping containers and COVID-19 safety measures have already been causing delays at ports.",
        "42 vessels (northbound) and 64 vessels (southbound) are waiting due to the blockage, with the numbers expected to rise.",
        "Chris Evans from Colliers International believes the blockage will be cleared quickly, minimizing delays.",
        "However, any prolonged blockage could lead to significant shipping delays, increased costs and operational challenges.",
        "Analysts and industry experts are concerned about the impact on global trade, including on oil prices and the necessity for ships to take longer routes."
