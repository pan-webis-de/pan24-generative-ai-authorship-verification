        "A container ship named the Ever Given, registered in Panama, is stuck sideways in Egypt's Suez Canal, blocking all traffic.",
        "The ship, which is 400m long and 59m wide, ran aground across the canal, causing a significant disruption to global shipping.",
        "More than 100 ships were prevented from passing through the canal by Thursday morning following the incident.",
        "Efforts to free the ship are ongoing, with at least eight tug boats involved according to Admiral Osama Rabie, chairman of the Suez Canal Authority.",
        "Egypt has reopened an older channel of the canal to alleviate some of the traffic until the Ever Given can be moved.",
        "The Suez Canal is a vital route for global trade, especially for oil transport, and the blockage raises concerns for ships in the Red Sea possibly becoming attack targets.",
        "Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, managing the Ever Given, confirmed all 20 crew members are safe with no injuries or pollution reported.",
        "The cause of the ship becoming wedged is unclear, with conflicting reports about a sandstorm and a blackout, though strong winds were mentioned as a factor.",
        "The blockage could severely impact global shipping, hampering the delivery of food, fuel, and goods between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea.",
        "The Suez Canal is a key link for global trade and a major income source for Egypt, having undergone a major expansion in 2015."
