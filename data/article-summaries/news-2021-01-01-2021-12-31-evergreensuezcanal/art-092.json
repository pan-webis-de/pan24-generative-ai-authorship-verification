        "A massive ship, Ever Given, is stuck in the Suez Canal, causing potential global trade and oil supply issues.",
        "The ship ran aground reportedly due to a strong gust of wind, blocking one of the world's most crucial shipping routes.",
        "Tug boats have partially refloated the ship, but there is fear of significant impacts on global trade.",
        "Around 30% of global container cargo traffic could be delayed, leading to shortages and price hikes.",
        "The blockage has already caused a pileup of at least 100 ships waiting to enter the canal.",
        "Brent crude oil prices jumped nearly 2.9% due to the blockage.",
        "Experts warn the blockage could have 'catastrophic' effects on trade, including delays in vaccine supply.",
        "Alternative shipping routes, such as rerouting around Africa, would significantly increase transit time by 12-14 days.",
        "If the ship cannot be quickly refloated, a complex operation will be necessary to remove cargo and fuel, which will take time.",
        "Opened in 1869, the Suez Canal is a vital link for transporting oil, natural gas, and cargo from East to West."
