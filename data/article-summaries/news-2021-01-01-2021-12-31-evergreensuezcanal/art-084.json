        "Ever Given, a 20,124 teu vessel, remains anchored in the Suez Canalâ€™s Great Bitter Lakes area after being refloated 2.5 months ago.",
        "The ship and its 18,000 teu of cargo are under arrest due to a compensation dispute between the owners and the Suez Canal Authority (SCA).",
        "The SCA has lowered its compensation claim from $916m to $550m, rejecting the shipowner's offer of $150m.",
        "North European importers with cargo on the Ever Given are considering abandoning it due to delays.",
        "Mathu Jagannath, director of NAU Pte, urges the SCA and shipowner to quickly resolve the dispute to minimize losses.",
        "The SCA attributes the accident to the ship's \"excessive speed,\" while the P&I Club blames SCA's control over navigation.",
        "Cargo owners must contribute to salvage costs due to the declaration of General Average, but cannot until the vessel is freed.",
        "The Ever Given is worth $183m, with its value increasing $13m since the grounding.",
        "It is unclear if Evergreen, the operator leasing the vessel, continues to pay daily hire while it is under arrest.",
        "The shortage and high demand for containership capacity make it urgent for Evergreen to return the Ever Given to service."
