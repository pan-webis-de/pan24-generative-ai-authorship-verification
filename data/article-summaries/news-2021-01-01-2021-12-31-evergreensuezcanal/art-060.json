        "A large container ship named Ever Given has run aground in Egypt's Suez Canal, blocking traffic in one of the world's busiest waterways.",
        "Eight tug boats are attempting to free the 224,000-ton vessel, which is flagged under Panama.",
        "The ship ran aground due to 40-knot winds and a sandstorm causing low visibility and poor navigation.",
        "The Ever Given, which is almost as long as the Empire State Building is tall, is causing a significant traffic jam in the canal.",
        "Tanker Trackers reports that tankers carrying oil from Saudi Arabia, Russia, Oman, and the US are among those waiting at both ends of the canal.",
        "The Suez Canal accounts for about 30% of global container ship traffic each day, with nearly 19,000 ships passing through in 2020.",
        "Maersk, the world's largest container shipping company, says seven of its vessels have been affected by the blockage.",
        "Re-floating the Ever Given is technically complicated and could take days, according to a senior canal pilot at the Suez Canal Authority.",
        "The canal pilot suggests that the ship is likely to be towed to the nearest parking site for offloading and minor repairs.",
        "The disruption may impact oil and gas flows depending on the duration it takes to clear the container ship, with industry sources suggesting it could be resolved in days rather than weeks."
