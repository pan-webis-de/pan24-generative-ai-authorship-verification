        "The Ever Given, a massive container ship, was successfully freed from the Suez Canal after being stuck for six days.",
        "The operation required a combination of dredging, tugboat maneuvering, and taking advantage of high tides.",
        "The ship became wedged in the canal on March 23 due to poor visibility and high winds, prompting a global effort to dislodge it.",
        "The Suez Canal is a crucial waterway for global trade, with about 15% of all shipping passing through it.",
        "Experts were initially unsure how to free the ship, likening its situation to \"an enormous beached whale.\"",
        "Dredgers and more than 10 tugboats worked round the clock, removing sand, mud, and water from around the vessel.",
        "The 10th of Ramadan and the Mashhour, two heavy-duty dredgers, played significant roles in the dredging process.",
        "To aid in refloating the ship, 9,000 tons of the Ever Given's ballast water were released.",
        "The ship was fully dislodged on March 29, following efforts that coincided with high tide conditions due to a full moon.",
        "The successful freeing of the Ever Given was celebrated by workers and had significant implications for global trade."
