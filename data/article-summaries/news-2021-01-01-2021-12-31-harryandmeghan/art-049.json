        "Canadian taxpayers paid over $334,000 to protect Prince Harry and his family during visits to Canada in less than four years.",
        "The cost included $182,430 for the period between April 1, 2017, and March 31, 2018, mainly covering overtime and travel costs of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).",
        "In January 2020, the RCMP estimated that monthly protection costs for the family could reach nearly $33,000.",
        "The protection costs arose from both public visits and private trips made by Prince Harry, including several to see Meghan Markle in Toronto.",
        "The popularity of the couple and the media attention they attracted added complexity to their security arrangements.",
        "The RCMP provided safety assessments and accompanying security for Prince Harry due to the potential risk their presence might pose to Canada's image.",
        "Once Prince Harry stepped back from royal duties, the RCMP's obligation to provide protection during his visits ended.",
        "The total security cost includes more than $93,000 for protecting the Sussexes during their Christmas 2019 stay in Canada.",
        "There is debate and concern over the transparency and necessity of these security expenditures among Canadians and officials.",
        "The Canadian Taxpayers Federation has called for greater transparency regarding the taxpayer money spent on these security measures."
