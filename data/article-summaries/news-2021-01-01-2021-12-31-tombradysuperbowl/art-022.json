        "Tom Brady, at age 43, led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a Super Bowl 55 victory during the pandemic.",
        "Brady's win marked the first time a quarterback won a Super Bowl in their team's home stadium.",
        "He achieved this feat while playing with a torn medial collateral ligament (MCL) in his left knee, which he suffered during his last season with the New England Patriots.",
        "The injury worsened over Brady's first season with the Bucs, leading to surgery in late February after winning his seventh Super Bowl.",
        "Brady has been vague about the specifics of his knee surgery, stating it was 'pretty serious.'",
        "He acknowledged that the knee injury occurred before his first snap with the Bucs in training camp.",
        "Brady had previously torn the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in the same knee in 2008.",
        "The MCL injury posed a risk of hyperextension and misalignment during movement, particularly affecting his ability to step into passes.",
        "Brady managed the injury through the 2020 season, limiting practices but still achieving impressive performance stats.",
        "He has been rehabilitating the knee in the offseason and is currently working out in altitude near his summer home in Montana."
