        "Vistra Corp increased its February winter storm Uri cost estimate to about $1.6 billion.",
        "The new estimate is up from the prior estimate of $900 million to $1.3 billion.",
        "The estimate excludes potential recoveries from legal and regulatory challenges.",
        "Vistra reissued its 2021 EBITDA and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow guidance.",
        "The revised EBITDA range is $1,475-$1,875 million and free cash flow range is $200-$600 million.",
        "Before the storm, Vistra estimated significantly higher EBITDA and free cash flow for 2021.",
        "CEO Curt Morgan stated the company generated more power than its market share during the storm.",
        "Vistra faced high costs due to unfulfilled gas contracts and had to buy power at high prices.",
        "Absent gas deliverability and cost issues, Uri would have had a slightly positive impact on 2021 EBITDA.",
        "Vistra will not buy additional shares in 2021 but will maintain its quarterly dividend."
