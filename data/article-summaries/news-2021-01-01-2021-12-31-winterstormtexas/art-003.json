        "The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) and utility engineers are urgently working to restore power.",
        "A record electric load due to extreme cold combined with over 30 gigawatts of generation capacity going offline led to widespread outages.",
        "Texas's isolated ERCOT grid, unlike interconnected regional grids in other states, limits power import/export during emergencies.",
        "Failure to winterize wind turbines and other generating infrastructure contributed significantly to the power shortages.",
        "The state's demand response system, which could manage demand during peak periods, is underdeveloped.",
        "Proposed fixes include winterizing power infrastructure, investing in High Voltage DC lines for better interconnection, scaling up demand response, and considering strategic energy storage reserves.",
        "The importance of resilient and sustainable energy infrastructure is emphasized for future extreme weather events.",
        "The article is co-authored by professors from Texas A&M, offering academic perspectives on the crisis and its solutions.",
