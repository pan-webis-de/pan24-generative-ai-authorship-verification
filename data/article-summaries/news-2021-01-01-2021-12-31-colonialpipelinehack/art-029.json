        "The demand for gasoline in the U.S. is described as 'inelastic,' meaning consumption doesn't change significantly even as prices rise.",
        "The study is Tsvetanov's first foray into economic research involving cybercrime, highlighting the growing threat of cyberattacks.",
        "Colonial paid a $4.4 million ransom in Bitcoin to the hackers, but the Justice Department later recovered $2.3 million of it.",
