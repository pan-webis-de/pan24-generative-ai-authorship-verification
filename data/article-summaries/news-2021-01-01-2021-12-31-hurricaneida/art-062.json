        "Restoration of wetlands and barrier islands is a key strategy in Louisiana's storm defense efforts, especially after hurricanes Katrina and Rita.",
        "Wetlands dissipation of storm energy is analogous to a cyclist riding over gravel, with more robust wetlands providing greater resistance.",
        "Despite their benefits, once wetlands are overwhelmed by water, their ability to slow down waves diminishes significantly.",
        "The Water Institute of the Gulf highlights the importance of wetlands for storm protection, supported by research and environmental groups.",
        "Louisiana has been investing heavily in restoring its natural barriers, creating or restoring significant marshland and barrier island areas since 2007.",
        "State's coastal protection and restoration plans included projects costing an estimated $50 billion, expected to prevent over $150 billion in damage over five decades.",
        "Louisiana's land loss problem has been ongoing since the 1930s, and current restoration efforts are only slowing down the loss, not reversing it.",
        "Wetlands not only protect against storms but also help in curbing erosion, preserving landscapes, and providing crucial habitat for wildlife and fisheries."
