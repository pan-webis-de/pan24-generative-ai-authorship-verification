        "Human-caused climate change is exacerbating the severity of hurricanes like Ida, making them wetter, slower, and generating larger storm surges.",
        "Hurricane Ida, fueled by warmer Gulf of Mexico waters, caused extensive damage in Mississippi and Louisiana, leading to power outages for over 1 million people.",
        "Katharine Hayhoe, Chief Scientist at the Nature Conservancy, emphasizes the increase in severity rather than frequency of storms as a key impact of climate change.",
        "Warming oceans are causing hurricanes to intensify more quickly, with Ida strengthening significantly before landfall.",
        "The global proportion of Category 3 to 5 hurricanes has been rising due to warmer ocean temperatures.",
        "Hurricane Ida produced over 15 inches of rain in parts of Louisiana, contributing to significant flooding.",
        "Increased atmospheric moisture due to warming allows hurricanes to generate more rainfall, making flooding more severe.",
        "Storm surges are worsening due to sea level rise, further amplifying the destructive impact of hurricanes.",
        "Louisiana's coastal wetlands, a natural defense against storm surge, are disappearing, worsening the effects of hurricanes like Ida.",
        "Experts argue for rapid greenhouse gas emission reductions to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change on hurricane severity."
