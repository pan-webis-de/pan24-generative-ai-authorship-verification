        "Twitter permanently suspended President Trump's account due to the risk of further incitement of violence.",
        "The suspension was in response to Trump's recent tweets and the context of events, particularly the violent events at the Capitol.",
        "Two specific tweets were cited as violating Twitter's policy against glorification of violence.",
        "One tweet discussed Trump's supporters and hinted at continuing support for those who believe he won the election.",
        "The other tweet announced Trump would not attend Joe Biden's inauguration, which Twitter viewed as potentially inciting violence.",
        "Twitter's ban is specifically for the @realDonaldTrump account, with measures to prevent ban evasion.",
        "Trump tested the ban evasion policy by tweeting from the @POTUS account, but those tweets were quickly removed.",
        "The Trump campaign's Twitter account was also permanently banned after attempting to share Trump's banned tweet.",
        "Civil rights leaders and organizations have praised Twitter's decision for taking a stand against hate speech and division.",
        "Twitter differentiated between journalists reporting on Trump's words and accounts attempting to circumvent the ban by repeating those words."
