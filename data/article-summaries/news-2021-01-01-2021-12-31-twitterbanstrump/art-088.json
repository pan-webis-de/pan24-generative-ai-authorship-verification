        "Following the Capitol Building breach by a mob incited by Trump, Facebook and Twitter banned the president from their platforms.",
        "Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg extended Trump's ban until at least January 20, post his term's end.",
        "The bans were a reaction to Trump's baseless claims about election fraud and the election being stolen, which he repeated on social media and at a rally.",
        "Gianluca Stringhini, an assistant professor at Boston University, supports the ban but warns of potential unforeseen consequences.",
        "Stringhini's research found that while bans on platforms like Reddit reduce posting activity, they can lead to increased toxicity and radicalization among migrated users.",
        "Online communities play a significant role in spreading conspiracy theories and disinformation, often moving from fringe platforms to mainstream social media.",
        "Stringhini believes that Trump's ban will short-term reduce the spread of conspiracy theories but may make his supporters feel censored.",
        "Trump's amplification of conspiracies from polarized communities has had a significant impact on disseminating false information.",
        "Research on banned communities shows a nuanced effect of platform moderation, where fewer users see toxic content, but those who do may become more extreme.",
        "Stringhini predicts that if Trump moves to an alternative platform, many of his supporters will likely follow him."
