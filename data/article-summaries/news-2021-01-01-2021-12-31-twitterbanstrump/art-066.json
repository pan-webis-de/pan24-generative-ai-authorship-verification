        "Twitter permanently banned President Donald Trump's personal account, which had 88.7 million followers.",
        "Trump's last tweets indicated refusal to attend the inauguration and voiced support for his supporters, hinting at a 'GIANT VOICE' for them in the future.",
        "Twitter cited the risk of further incitement of violence as the reason for the permanent suspension.",
        "The decision follows Trump's history of pushing the boundaries of Twitter's rules against election misinformation, glorifying violence, and COVID-19 falsehoods.",
        "After the suspension, Trump attempted to use the @POTUS account to criticize Twitter and claim suppression of free speech, but those tweets were deleted.",
        "Twitter stated Trump's use of the @POTUS account as an attempt to evade suspension, violating its rules.",
        "The @TeamTrump account was also permanently suspended for ban evasion.",
        "Facebook and Instagram have suspended Trump's accounts indefinitely, at least through the end of his term.",
        "The ban followed Twitter locking Trump out of his account after a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol.",
        "Twitter's enforcement follows their public interest framework but emphasizes that no account is above the rules."
