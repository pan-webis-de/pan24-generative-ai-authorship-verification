        "Twitter permanently suspended President Donald Trump's account due to the risk of further incitement of violence.",
        "The decision came in response to fears that Trump's recent tweets were interpreted as supporting rioters and encouraging armed protests, including a proposed attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 17.",
        "Trump's suspension effectively bans him from the platform; his tweets and profile picture were deleted.",
        "Trump had 88.7 million followers before the suspension. Institutional accounts like @POTUS and @WhiteHouse remain active but with limited capabilities.",
        "Trump accused Twitter of coordinating with Democrats and the Radical Left, claiming censorship and referencing Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.",
        "Twitter's actions followed a broader trend where social media platforms, including Facebook, have begun to more strictly enforce policies against Trump.",
        "Twitter and Facebook had temporarily suspended Trump's accounts on Jan. 6 during the Capitol riot, with Facebook extending its suspension indefinitely.",
        "Trump's tweets after the riot, perceived to glorify violence and undermine the transition of power, were direct factors in Twitter's decision to suspend his account.",
        "The suspension marks a significant shift in how tech companies handle Trump's account, bringing attention to the role of social media in political discourse.",
        "In response to suspension, Trump and his supporters criticized the move as an attack on free speech and an example of tech companies' alleged bias against conservatives."
