        "Sheriff's department decisions during the Tiger Woods car crash investigation are scrutinized by forensic experts.",
        "Sheriff Alex Villanueva initially stated there was no evidence of impairment and deemed the crash an 'accident'.",
        "No drug-recognition expert (DRE) was brought in to evaluate Woods for impairment at the scene.",
        "Evidence suggests that Woods might have been inattentive or asleep, with no indication of braking or steering away from the crash path.",
        "Experts argue the absence of braking evidence and Woods' memory loss about driving could indicate impairment, warranting a DRE assessment.",
        "A DRE assessment involves a 12-step process, including questioning about medications and examining vital signs, without automatic blood testing.",
        "Villanueva justified the decision not to use a DRE by citing the deputy's assessment of Woods as lucid and showing no signs of impairment.",
        "Accident reconstruction experts argue the crash characteristics resemble those of a person falling asleep at the wheel.",
        "Woods suffered broken bones in his right leg and facial injuries, but no head injuries were reported.",
        "The lack of initial DRE assessment and blood evidence means it's now too late to obtain Woods' hospital blood and medical reports without his cooperation or a search warrant."
